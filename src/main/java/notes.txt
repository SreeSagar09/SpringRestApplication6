A Program to demonstrate the use of @RequestMapping annotation attributes consumes, produces:
Programs:
* AppConfig.java
* AppInit.java
* ApplicationController1.java
* ApplicationController2.java
Notes:
* @RequestMapping annotation accept eight attributes those are name, value, path, method, params, headers, consumes, produces
* The purpose of the consumes and produces attributes are to narrowing the primary mapping by media type and the method consumes and produces the defined media type.
* The consumes and produces attributes are supported at class level and method level also, if we defined at class level that attributes are inherits to the method levels also.
* If this attributes are defined both class and method level, then method level defined attributes override the class level defined attributes.
* If this attributes are not defined then that handler method can supported to produces and consumes the all types of media types.
* If the handler method consumes json media types but access that method with different media type then it gives '415 – Unsupported Media Type'.
* If the handler method produces json media types but access that method with different media type then it gives '406 – Not Acceptable'
